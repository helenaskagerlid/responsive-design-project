  //   width: min() is a css funnction contains of two different parameters and it is used to set to the smallest
  //   css rule compared to its parents width. So in this case the element with class wrapper will be either
  //   100% - 48px of the screen size OR 1200px wide, it will choose the one which is smallest.
  //   This helps so that the content is nicely responsive to different screens but doesnt scale endlessly bigger
  //   and get out of porportion big on x-large screens.
  margin-inline: auto;
  //   margin-inline only effect the margin on left and right side.
