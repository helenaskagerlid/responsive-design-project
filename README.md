# Responsive Design for Beginners: Course Project

Welcome! üëãüèº This repository contains the project I built while taking Jessica Chan‚Äôs Responsive Design for Beginners course. The course focuses on developing professional-level web development skills by building a website from a Figma design using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.
About the Project

This project demonstrates the process of creating a responsive, accessible website from scratch. 

## The course covered:

    Setting up a development workflow with VS Code, GitHub, and Sass compilation.
    Interpreting Figma designs into semantic HTML and structured SCSS styles.
    Creating responsive layouts with Flexbox and CSS Grid.
    Implementing modern CSS techniques like clamp(), calc(), and custom properties.
    Deploying the completed site to Netlify.

Throughout the project, I learned to solve common web design challenges, such as making designs responsive, optimizing images for different devices, and organizing project files efficiently.

## Key Features

    Built the core structure of the website using semantic HTML.
    Styled components with SCSS using BEM methodology, mixins, and partials.
    Developed a responsive layout with media queries, ensuring the website works on all screen sizes.
    Enhanced user experience with hover effects, linear-gradient() backgrounds, and transitions.
    Added more advanced sections and animations, including:
        Custom hover effects with animated underlines.
        Use of SVG shapes and absolute positioning for intricate designs.
        Alternating content blocks styled with nth-child selectors.

    Accessibility: Writing semantic HTML and ensuring responsive images and typography.
    Developer tools: Debugging and refining styles with Firefox Developer Tools.

## Deployment

The final website is live on Netlify, showcasing everything from accessible navigation to responsive layouts and animations.
